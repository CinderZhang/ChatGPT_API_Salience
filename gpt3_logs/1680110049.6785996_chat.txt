==========

Given the limitation on the number of tokens supported by the OpenAI API (typically around 4096 tokens), embedding the full text of a 100,000-token 10-K report is not feasible. However, you can modify the code to extract relevant sections from the annual report and use context to ensure a summary or representation of the main ideas is passed to the API. 

Here's an updated version of the Python code to handle the large text:

```python
import os
import json
import openai
from arelle import Cntlr, ModelManager, FileSource

# PART 1: Read the local XBRL format 10-K annual report

# Set the report file path
xbrl_file_path = 'path/to/your/10-k/report.xbrl'

# Initialize Arelle controller and model manager
arelle_controller = Cntlr.Cntlr()
arelle_model_manager = ModelManager.initialize(arelle_controller)

# Load the XBRL report model
report_model = arelle_model_manager.load(FileSource.FileSource(xbrl_file_path))

# Extract useful information from the report model
facts_list = report_model.facts

# Add filter conditions or select specific facts based on your requirement
# Here, we limit the number of facts to a max number of tokens that GPT-3 can handle
max_num_tokens = 4096
selected_facts = [str(fact) for fact in facts_list][:max_num_tokens]

facts_summary = '\n'.join(selected_facts)

# PART 2: Prepare the data for ChatGPT/OpenAI API
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
prompt_text = f"Process and chat about the following 10-K financial report data (limit to {max_num_tokens} tokens):\n\n{facts_summary}\n"

# PART 3: Chat about the 10-K report using ChatGPT/OpenAI API
def chat_with_gpt(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="davinci-codex",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.5,
    )

    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

chat_response = chat_with_gpt(prompt_text)
print(chat_response)
```

By using `[:max_num_tokens]`, the code extracts a truncated representation of the annual report based on the maximum supported number of tokens. Currently, it takes the first `max_num_tokens` (in this case, 4096) tokens of the facts. Make sure you replace the example with the actual path to your file and OpenAI API key.

Note that this approach will still only provide a partial understanding of the 10-K report due to the token limitation. It is recommended to pre-process your document, extract essential sections, or create a summary before sending the text to the API.
