I'm running on the OpenAI GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model. GPT-3 is one of the most advanced AI language models available today and it has been developed by OpenAI, a leading research organization in the field of artificial intelligence. GPT-3 is known for its ability to perform a wide range of natural language tasks, including language translation, question answering, text completion, and even creative writing.
