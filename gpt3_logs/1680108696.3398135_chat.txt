==========

To achieve your requirements, we can use Python libraries such as `aiohttp` for asynchronous requests and `lxml` for reading XBRL format files. I'll provide you an example script. Make sure to replace `<your_api_key>` with your actual OpenAI API key.

```python
import asyncio
import json
from aiohttp import ClientSession
from lxml import etree

# Read XBRL file
def read_xbrl(filename):
    tree = etree.parse(filename)
    return etree.tostring(tree, encoding='unicode')

# Process XBRL file for ChatGPT
def process_xbrl(xbrl_content):
    # Modify this function according to your processing requirements
    return xbrl_content

# Chat with ChatGPT API
async def chat_with_chatgpt(prompt, api_key):
    url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
    }
    data = {
        "model": "text-davinci-002",
        "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": prompt}]
    }

    async with ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data)) as response:
            result = await response.json()
            return result

async def main():
    filename = "example.xbrl"  # Replace with your 10-K annual report XBRL file
    xbrl_content = read_xbrl(filename)
    processed_xbrl = process_xbrl(xbrl_content)

    api_key = "<your_api_key>"
    prompt = f"Please analyze the following 10-K XBRL data:\n{processed_xbrl}"
    chat_response = await chat_with_chatgpt(prompt, api_key)

    print(chat_response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Remember to install required libraries if you haven't already:

```
pip install aiohttp lxml
```

This script reads an XBRL format 10-K annual report file, processes it (you can modify the `process_xbrl` function as needed), and sends it as a prompt to the ChatGPT API. The response from the API is printed to the console.
