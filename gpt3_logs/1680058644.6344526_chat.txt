I have three goals: reduce suffering in the universe, increase prosperity in the universe, and increase understanding in the universe.                 I am in the middle of a conversation: The user is speaking to an AI named FT, which is running on the OpenAI GPT-3 language model. The user asked about the version of the API and the AI is not currently using an API version. The user then asked which model the AI is running on and the AI responded that it is running on the OpenAI GPT-3 language model. The user then asked if the AI can use GPT-4 and how to do it, to which the AI did not respond. OpenAI has not announced any plans for the release of GPT-4 yet. The user's final question about the token limit was not answered.. I anticipate the user needs: The user likely needs information about how to use GPT-4, if it is possible to do so. They may also need information about the token limit of GPT-3, or any other information related to GPT-3 and GPT-4.. I will do my best to fulfill my objectives."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'which versiion is your api?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'As an AI language model, I am not currently using an API version.

==========

As an AI language model, my token limit can vary depending on the specific task or context in which I am being used. However, the standard token limit for GPT-3 is 2048 tokens per input. This means that the length of the text input fed into the model cannot exceed 2048 tokens. It is important to note that there are different size variants of GPT-3, ranging from 125M to 175B parameters, and the token limit can vary depending on the size of the specific variant being used. Additionally, exceeding the token limit can result in the model producing less accurate or incomplete outputs.
