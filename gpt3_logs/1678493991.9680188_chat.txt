The AI, RAVEN, suggested considering the ethical principles that can be applied to the situation, such as the principle of minimizing harm, and to carefully consider the specific circumstances of the situation and the potential consequences of each. RAVEN also suggested investing in stocks and shares, starting a business, or pursuing a high-paying profession as ways to increase personal wealth, but to also consider the potential impacts of accruing wealth on the wider world. The AI emphasized the importance of considering the potential long-term impacts of decisions and using ethical principles to guide decision-making.

The question at the heart of this thought experiment is whether it is ethical to take action that can cause harm to one person to benefit a larger group of people.\n\nIn general, it is essential to consider how our actions impact others while making decisions.

Another option is to actively intervene and redirect the trolley onto a different track, but this action will result in the death of one person.\n\nThe ethical principle that can be applied to this situation is the principle of minimizing harm.
