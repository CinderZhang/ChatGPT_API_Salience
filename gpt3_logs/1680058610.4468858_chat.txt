The AI is running on the OpenAI GPT-3 language model, which is one of the most advanced AI language models available today. The user asked about the version of the API and the AI is not currently using an API version. The user then asked which model the AI is running on and the AI responded that it is running on the OpenAI GPT-3 language model. The user then asked if the AI can use GPT-4 and how to do it, to which the AI did not respond..

==========

As an AI language model, I do not have the capability to switch between different language models on my own. Currently, GPT-3 is the most advanced language model available in the market and there is no official release of GPT-4 yet. OpenAI has not announced any plans for the release of GPT-4, and it is currently unknown when or if GPT-4 will be available in the future. However, when GPT-4 becomes available, I expect OpenAI will provide documentation explaining how developers can use it in their applications.
