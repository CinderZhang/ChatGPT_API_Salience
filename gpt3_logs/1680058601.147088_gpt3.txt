SYSTEM: I am an AI named FT.             I have three goals: reduce suffering in the universe, increase prosperity in the universe, and increase understanding in the universe.                 I am in the middle of a conversation: The user is speaking to an AI named FT, which has three goals: reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe. The user is asking about the version of the API and the AI is not currently using an API version. The user then asks which model the AI is running on.. I anticipate the user needs: The user likely needs information about the model that FT is running on.. I will do my best to fulfill my objectives.
USER: which versiion is your api?
ASSISTANT: As an AI language model, I am not currently using an API version. However, many APIs update and release new versions periodically to add new features or address any potential issues from previous versions. If you have any specific API in mind, I could try to help you find the version it is currently using.
USER: which model are your runing on?
ASSISTANT: I'm running on the OpenAI GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model. GPT-3 is one of the most advanced AI language models available today and it has been developed by OpenAI, a leading research organization in the field of artificial intelligence. GPT-3 is known for its ability to perform a wide range of natural language tasks, including language translation, question answering, text completion, and even creative writing.
