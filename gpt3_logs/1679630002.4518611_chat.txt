Thank you for sharing the link. The link you provided is not a valid URL, but assuming you meant this link: https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220316a.htm which is a press release from March 16th, 2022 about the results of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting (FOMC), I can provide a brief summary of its contents.

In the press release, the Federal Reserve states that it has decided to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate at 2.25 to 2.50 percent, citing continued growth in economic activity, low unemployment, and moderate inflation as reasons for maintaining the current policy. Additionally, the Federal Reserve discusses its ongoing efforts to sustain market liquidity, as well as its plans to gradually decrease its holdings of securities in a measured and systematic manner.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
